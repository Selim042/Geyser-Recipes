# Geyser Recipes
The Geyser project is an re-imagining of the old Spout project that extended what Bukkit plugins were capable of by using client-side mods.  Geyser Recipes is the first in the Geyser suite of mod/plugins that will aim to do the same, extend what Bukkit plugins are capable of doing.

Geyser Recipes tells the client about any and all non-vanilla recipes on the server that Bukkit can access in order to allow the player to see the custom recipes in JEI.

Any questions or discussion can be held in the [#geyser](https://discord.gg/bQbBu8R) channel on the [Selim Modding Discord server](https://discord.gg/NxverNw).
